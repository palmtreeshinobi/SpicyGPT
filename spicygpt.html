            This was a little project I played around with where I asked OpenAI's ChatGPT to code a Herbert Frank inspired (Dune) magic 8 ball web application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The best part is, I don't even really know HTML, CSS, or Javascript. I know enough Python to get by but I would say ChatGPT has massively expanded my develper capabilities. I'm excited to take on more ambitious projects and leverage this new tech!
